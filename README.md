# About this project

This is a relatively simple template that combines the following crates into a base for future work:

- axum
- async-graphql
- dotenv
- metrics
- opentelemetry
- tracing
- tokio

## What you can use this for

If you plan to implement a GraphQL API in Rust, you can use this template as a starting point.

It comes with metrics and tracing pre-configured. Setting those up is usually a lot of boiler plate and differs from web server to web server. In this case, you don't have to worry about these aspects of your service at all.
